# 🌤️ WeatherGPT (SIH26068)
### Conversational AI for Weather Forecasting, Alerts, and Climate Information
**Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES) | India Meteorological Department (IMD) | Theme: Disaster Management**

---

## 📌 Project Overview
**WeatherGPT** solves the **"last mile"** meteorological dissemination problem. India has vast amounts of weather data (IMD bulletins, Mausam app, Doppler radar, satellite imagery), but for an ordinary citizen, farmer, or traveler, this scattered technical data is difficult to interpret and act upon.

WeatherGPT provides an **authoritative, conversational AI layer** that:
1. Understands natural language voice and text queries in **Hindi, Hinglish, and English**.
2. Retrieves verified meteorological forecasts from **Open-Meteo & Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP)** models (ECMWF, GFS, ICON).
3. Evaluates severe weather thresholds and displays **NDMA SACHET / IMD CAP Early Warnings**.
4. Generates tailored, actionable domain advisories for **Farmers (Kisan 🌾)**, **Travelers (Yatri ✈️)**, **Urban Residents (Nagrik 🏙️)**, and **Disaster Officers (🚨)**.
5. **Prevents Hallucinations (Grounded AI)**: The AI never invents weather numbers; it only interprets and translates verified meteorological datasets.

## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### 1. Run Backend (FastAPI)
The backend uses Python 3.12 managed via `uv`:

```bash
# Navigate to backend folder
cd weathergpt/backend

# Activate virtual environment (Windows PowerShell)
.\.venv\Scripts\activate

# Start the server
uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
```
The interactive API documentation (Swagger UI) is available at: **http://localhost:8000/docs**

### 2. Run Frontend
The frontend is a lightweight, mobile-first web app located in `weathergpt/frontend`.
Simply open `weathergpt/frontend/index.html` in any modern web browser (Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Brave) or serve it with any static server:

```bash
# Optional: using Python to serve frontend
cd weathergpt/frontend
python -m http.server 3000
```
Then visit **http://localhost:3000** in your browser.

## 🎯 Winning Pitch for SIH Judges

### Q1: *"Mausam app already exists, why WeatherGPT?"*
> **Answer:** *"Mausam app and IMD portals are primarily one-way data display dashboards with raw numbers (e.g., 28°C, 82% humidity, 60% precipitation). WeatherGPT is an intelligent conversational layer that allows citizens to ask follow-up questions in their native language and receive contextual, decision-oriented advice—such as whether a farmer should irrigate their crops or a traveler should delay a road journey due to hydroplaning hazards."*

### Q2: *"How do you prevent the AI from hallucinating a wrong forecast?"*
> **Answer:** *"Our AI never predicts weather. We follow a strict Grounded Architecture: the LLM parses the user's intent and location, our deterministic backend fetches verified data from Open-Meteo and official early warning feeds, and the AI is strictly constrained to narrate that verified data in human-friendly language."*

### Q3: *"What is your production data source plan?"*
> **Answer:** *"For this rapid prototype, we use Open-Meteo and open meteorological APIs (zero-setup, global NWP models). In production, WeatherGPT is designed to integrate directly with IMD's official APIs and the Bharat Forecasting System (BFS) 6 km grid via MoES/NDMA CAP feeds."*
